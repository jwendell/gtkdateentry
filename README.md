GtkDateEntry
============

** Prototype of a DateEntry widget, for Gtk+ 3 **

Its usage is simple, as any other gtk+ widget:

* To create: _gtk_date_entry_new ()_
* To retrieve the date selected by the user: _gtk_date_entry_get_date()_

Check _gtkdateentry.h_ file to see the whole _API_.

This is still in early stage, has lots of rooms for improvements.
I'm using it in a personal project, and it's usable right now.

Feel free to fork / make improvements / file bugs / pull requests.
